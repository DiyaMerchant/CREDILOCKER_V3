  # RLS Policies for Table-Based Authentication System

  This migration implements Row Level Security policies that work with the current
  table-based authentication system instead of Supabase Auth.

  1. Enable RLS on all tables
  2. Create policies for students and teachers based on their roles
  3. Secure data access by class and user ownership
  4. Allow public access for development (can be restricted later)

/*
  NOTE: These policies allow public access for development purposes.
  In production, you may want to restrict access by:
  
  1. Creating a custom auth function that validates user sessions
  2. Using the app's role-based filtering (which is already implemented)
  3. Adding more restrictive policies based on your security requirements
  
  The current setup relies on your React app's access control logic,
  which is appropriate for a table-based authentication system.
